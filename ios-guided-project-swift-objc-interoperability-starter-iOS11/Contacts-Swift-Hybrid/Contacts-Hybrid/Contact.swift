// QUESTION: Why did I use a class?

// struct from Swift doesn't work in Objective-C
// Must use a class in Swift if we want to use it from Objective-C
// ModelController is going to be in Objective-C

//@objc(LSIContact)	// Rename our Swift class to LSIContact (Buggy with Objective-C forward class declaration)
// BUG: Going from Swift to Objective-C to Swift seems to cause problems with renaming the build symbol
//@objcMembers // Expose all properties to Objective-C
@objc
class Contact: NSObject {
	@objc var name: String
	@objc var relationship: String?
	
	@objc init(name: String, relationship: String?) {
		self.name = name
		self.relationship = relationship
	}
}

// 1. Use Swift Classes
// 2. Subclass NSObject
// 3. mark your properties/methods with @objc (@objcMembers)
